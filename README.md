# mytodolistapp
My to do list app is not complete yet

# Here's the action item

:: If trash == 'true', pending task will decreased - done using filter function

:: If the to do list exceed 1 line, the next list is overwritten - not yet

Shall add, date reminder to remind me when to do the task

I'm using localStorage for saving my list.
